# Welcome! 👋

This website hosts the course material for **Math 5650/6650** at Auburn University.

The course will emphasize both theories and implementation of the common optimization methods. The theory part follows the textbooks

- :closed_book: ``Numerical Optimization`` by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen Wright. We probably will not cover the ``linear programming`` due to the limitation on course hours.  
- :closed_book: ``Convex Optimization`` by Lieven Vandenberghe and Stephen P. Boyd. You may download the book from <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf>. We may use this book for references.

## Prerequisite

- :heavy_check_mark: Linear Differential Equations (2650)
- :heavy_check_mark: Topics in Linear Algebra (2660)
- :heavy_check_mark: Any programming language for computing. ``Python``, ``Matlab``, ``Julia`` are highly preferred. 

## Assignments

### Bi-weekly submissions

- :pencil2: Basic theory exercises
- :computer: Optimization projects

### Final Group Projects

The final group project evaluation consists of two parts.

- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Project Report (LaTEX mandatory, template will be provided)
- :microphone: Presentation (15 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A)

### Grades

- Bi-weekly submissions: 70%
- Final Project: 30%

## Discussion

- General discussion: Please read the discussion (<https://github.com/orgs/math-5650-6650/discussions>) for more information about the class. If you have question about the information, simply start a new discussion.
- Technical discussion: We will tentatively use slack or discord for group chatting and direct messages instead of posting announcements through canvas.
